👋 Hi, I’m @RepoRanger-Sid
👀 I’m interested in leveraging programming to solve complex structural engineering challenges, creating automation tools, and exploring innovative tech for the construction and design industry.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced computational design tools to optimize engineering workflows.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to structural analysis, automation scripts, and anything that bridges the gap between engineering and technology.
